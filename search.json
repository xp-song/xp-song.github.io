    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the way we work and play1. As more people work remotely from home, visits to local parks have surged as people look for ways to stay active, find solace and quench their thirst for adventure2. Such opportunities for leisure and recreation play an important part in people’s physical and psychological well-being3.\nNot all parks are created equal. For example, people seeking solace may be drawn to waterfront or nature parks with open or tranquil landscapes4. For others who love adventure (like myself), bike trails are great to break a sweat while having fun with friends. But most of the bike trails in Singapore5 are really hard to get to from where I live (not to mention figuring out bike transport). So, instead of heading out for some adventure, I tend to visit the open field and playground closest to home, going out for short walks with my son (still waiting for my next adrenaline fix!).\nIn city planning, park provision is typically measured by summarising the park area within a given region6. Beyond the area of parks, however, there is a need to characterise the wide variety of parks that serve different groups of people. Understanding such nuances in park access can benefit both residents and city planners, for instance, when considering the location of a new home, or when planning for new parks in the city.\nOur new R package home2park provides ways to measure a variety of park features related to recreation such as foot/cycle trails, waterfronts, forests, open spaces, playgrounds and sport/fitness amenities. It includes functions to download such data from OSM. Alternatively, you may supply your own proprietary datasets, or use new data for the purpose of future scenario planning. Summarising these features at each park allows us to make quantitative comparisons between parks. Some examples are shown below for the city of Singapore, based on OSM data in the year 2020. For instance, parks with extensive trails provide opportunities for running/wheeled sports:\nOther features such as water and vegetation are associated with visual relief, as well as restorative effects on people’s psychological well-being7. If such data (e.g., satellite imagery) are available, they can also be summarised at each park:\nTo calculate the ‘supply’ of these parks features to homes city-wide, these summarised values per park can then be assigned to each residential building. Since people are less likely to visit parks further away from their homes, a ‘distance decay’ parameter can be included. This reduces the supply value originating from parks further away. The ‘distance decay’ for walking to urban parks was empirically determined in Tu et al.8 to fit a negative exponential curve with a coefficient c value of 0.661 (see home2park package for details). The example below shows the supply of park area to residential buildings in Singapore.\nNotice how the largest parks in Singapore tend to be centrally located, especially since we include informal nature areas (e.g., Central Catchment Nature Reserve). Buildings closer to these huge parks would thus have a much larger ‘supply’ of park area. However, each of the residential buildings would have different numbers of people living in them. A large park next to high-rise apartments would benefit a lot more people compared to low-rise housing. If we take into account the number of residents living within each building, a very different picture emerges!\nThese building-level metrics can subsequently be summarised across larger regions, for example, based on zones used in city planning. Not surprisingly, the supply metric for park area derived from individual buildings is vastly different from conventional metrics used today (examples in Tan and Samsudin9). Feel free to explore these metrics for the provision of park area in the interactive map below.\nIn these unprecedented times, significant changes to human mobility and working environments will require us to rethink land use distribution in the city, particularly for office, residential and public spaces such as parks. Some evidence also point to shifting preferences, for example, toward wilder green areas10. These issues are starting to become a part of the national conversation in Singapore 11, which is important considering that the city has major plans for sustainable development and greening over the next decade12. As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, there will be 1,000 ha (more than 1,800 football fields!) more parks and park connectors, and every household will live just a 10-minute walk away from a park13. In view of these major plans, there is a need to move beyond basic summaries of area, and consider the variety of parks features that are important for outdoor recreation. The R package home2park represents a part of our effort to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of outdoor recreation and its spatial provision in cities. Note that the package is still experimental, so do reach out if you would like to contribute to improvements, or to report any bugs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you’ve ever had to coordinate the writing of a document with multiple authors, you’ll probably understand the pain of handling everyone’s comments and edits. Once that’s finally done, it’s often useful to highlight all changes made to the original document. This is common practice in academic writing, for example, when re-submitting a revised manuscript after a round of review.\nHowever, most journals don’t accept documents with Microsoft Word’s ‘tracked changes’. I mean… who wants to read through a jungle of strikethroughs, comment bubbles and rainbow-colored text? They want a nice, clean document without the mess. To show changes from the original document, highlighted text or a different font color would be acceptable at most.\nSo, I did some searching online, and found some macros to do just that. I really wish I’d discovered this earlier, rather than manually formatting those texts…\nThe following macro accepts and highlights all changes in yellow. Other highlight colors can be found here, in replacement of WdYellow.\nSub tracked_to_highlighted()           \n        tempState = ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions\n        ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions = False    \n        For Each Change In ActiveDocument.Revisions        \n            Set myRange = Change.Range\n            myRange.Revisions.AcceptAll\n            myRange.HighlightColorIndex = WdYellow            \n        Next    \n        ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions = tempState\n    End Sub\nIf you’d rather change the font color, you can use a slightly different version shown below. Different font colors can also be assigned based on the RGB color code (e.g. RGB(0, 0, 255)), under the field ‘myRange.Font.Color’.\nSub tracked_to_bluefont()           \n        tempState = ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions\n        ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions = False    \n        For Each Change In ActiveDocument.Revisions        \n            Set myRange = Change.Range\n            myRange.Revisions.AcceptAll\n            myRange.Font.Color = 12611584         \n        Next    \n        ActiveDocument.TrackRevisions = tempState\n    End Sub"

    "text": "In landscape ecology, we study interactions between organisms and their surrounding environment. The physical landscape is often quantified using ‘landscape metrics’, for further analyses alongside other sources of data.\nMy recent lectures are focused on introducing such concepts to landscape architects. While I’ve used FRAGSTATS and other GIS software for teaching in the past, I’ve always struggled with compatibility/licensing issues that just made the whole process really cumbersome.\nRecently, I came across this R package called landscapemetrics—I was blown away. I’ve always wanted to introduce people to spatial analyses in R, and to show how a programmatic, reproducible workflow in R can be an excellent alternative to conventional software. This was the tipping point for me… I decided to give it a shot!\nThis post provides a preview of the workshop content. The workshop is meant to be a follow-up lesson to the Introduction to R series I’ll be conducting next semester."

    "title": "The performance of city trees",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Trees are often the largest components of landscape greenery, and can help enhance the environmental quality of city landscapes. For example, trees can lower temperatures by providing shade, and reduce the risk of flooding by intercepting rainfall. Such benefits accumulate across wider areas, producing substantial effects that can help make cities more liveable and adaptable to climate change. Trees are thus a form of ‘natural capital’ that produce value for people.\nMany cities have started to assess the status and health of these natural capital assets, which is an important step to incorporate the environment into holistic, national-scale planning. The downstream effects associated with trees often rely on their size and structure, which varies between species and changes over time. For practical purposes, however, measuring these multiple dimensions is usually not possible. Such values may have to be estimated indirectly using allometric relationships between the quantities of interest and easily-measured parameters such as a tree’s trunk diameter.\nAs part of my PhD work, I developed the R package allometree to build such allometric relationships, as well as a prototype web application demonstrating how the package may be used. If you’re interested, you may check out the following publication:\nRapid advances in remote sensing may soon reduce the manual effort required for data collection, and shift research and development toward real-time monitoring for tree management. However, systems and workflows will need to evolve to take advantage of such innovations. Work is needed to streamline data pipelines for analyses, and to integrate multiple datasets and objectives effectively for decision-making."

Here is a brief summary of the steps and template R code used to derive land cover classes from publicly-available Sentinel-2 imagery.

This allows us to avoid relying on any one image for our analysis, and to deal with missing data (e.g., due to high cloud cover) during the period of interest. Depending on the data type, we can scale the values and remove outliers prior to forming the image mosaic. You might also want to consider parallelising the code if there are many files.

    "text": "Classify land cover\nAt this point, we have a single image mosaic (raster) for each spectral index. While the continuous values from these rasters may be used directly in analyses, there may be instances were we want to work with discrete classes of land cover. One method is to separate pixels into one of two classes (e.g., vegetated or non-vegetated; water or land), based on an adaptively derived threshold value. For example, we use Otsu’s thresholding (Otsu, 1979), which tends to outperform other techniques in terms of stability of results and processing speed, even with the presence of &gt; 2 peaks in the histogram of pixel values (Bouhennache et al., 2019; see figure below). This may be implemented using the otsu() function in library(EBImage):\n\nthreshold_value &lt;- EBImage::otsu(mosaic, \n                                 range = c(-1, 1), # histogram range\n                                 levels = 256) # depends on image bit-depth\n\nclassified &lt;- mosaic # duplicate\n\nclassified[mosaic &lt; threshold_value] &lt;- 0 # assign value of 0 for pixels below threshold (e.g. non-vegetated)\nclassified[mosaic &gt;= threshold_value] &lt;- 1 # assign value of 1 for pixels above threshold (e.g. vegetated)\n\nAs an example, the following figure shows the distribution of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values of a raster image. The NDVI is a measure of healthy green vegetation, based on the tendency of plants to reflect NIR & absorb red light. It ranges from -1 (non-vegetated) to 1 (densely vegetated). Pixels that fall within the range of different threshold values (vertical lines) may be classified into discrete land cover types. If we do this for multiple date ranges, we can examine differences between the two. For example, in our project, we are currently comparing image mosaics captured during 2016–2019 (Survey Round One) and those captured during 2019–2022 (Survey Round Two). Each spectral index can be processed in different ways, and often have different threshold values if they are used for land classification. For example, there are numerous other vegetation indices (e.g., NDRE, ARVI), as well as spectral indices used to classify water (e.g., NDWI) and built (e.g., NDBI) cover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of NDVI values across Singapore in Survey Round One (light green bars, dashed vertical lines) and Two (dark green bars, solid vertical lines). Vegetation was classified as pixel with values &gt; 0.35 for Round One and &gt; 0.36 for Round Two. Dense vegetation was classified as pixels with values &gt; 0.62 for Round One and &gt; 0.66 for Round Two, based on a second round of Otsu’s thresholding after the first round of classification."

Spectral indices (whether classified or not) can be summarised within each zone, to allow comparisons to be made between these planning units.\nHere’s a map showing the proportional area and change in the basic types of land cover within municipal subzones in Singapore. The image quality, NDVI and classified vegetation for both survey rounds are also viewable. Note that the reported amount of NA pixels have been scaled up substantially (×1015) for the purpose of visualisation, so the image quality is actually pretty good (i.e., low cloud cover). This means that differences between survey rounds are unlikely to be due to differences in image quality. You may toggle the visibility of the different layers within the map.\n\n\n\nBased on this comparison of satellite images captured between Survey Round One and Two, we find that:\n\nSparse vegetation increased within the Central Water Catchment and offshore islands. However, dense vegetation decreased substantially within these areas too.\nWater cover at the eastern (North Eastern Islands) and western (Tuas View Extension) tips of Singapore decreased, but increased at north-western areas, Jurong Island and the Central Water Catchment.\nBuilt cover decreased substantially within Jurong Island and along the south-western coast of Singapore.\n\n\nWhat factors have contributed to land cover changes during this period of time?

    "text": "Food security is emerging as a serious threat in many parts of the world. In cities, common strategies to improve the resilience of food supplies are to diversify the sources of food, and to optimise local production. In compact cities where land is scarce, vertical and rooftop farming have been explored as alternatives to conventional agriculture. However, the success of such measures rely on their environmental, social and economic feasilibility within the local context.\nMy Honors Thesis assessed the suitability of light conditions along the vertical surfaces of buildings in Singapore, a dense and compact city in the tropics. These conditions were compared against the light requirements of vegetable crops that require high amounts of light, and that form a significant proportion of the staple diet in many Asian countries. Plant physiological variables such as dark respiration (Rd), light compensation point, light saturation point, photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and quantum yield (Φ) were derived. These were used to calculate plant light requirements, or the ‘Daily Light Integral’, which ranged from 10–30 mol m-2 day-1. Depending on the building height, orientation and configuration, light conditions along vertical surfaces ranged from 2–35 mol m-2 day-1."

I must say, it got really interesting and I decided to take the deep dive… hopefully this’ll help build some online visibility and get my work out there. If you’re also interested in building a website, check out Alistair Bailey’s “Building a website using blogdown in R”. At first I tried to use Jekyll but changed my mind after reading this post. I used the two-repository approach to link my website to GitHub pages, following the workflow by Tyler Clavelle.\nAs for blogging, I think it’s a great way to document the little things I’ve discovered or ideas I’ve had. Blogs have become a go-to for me when seeking answers to various questions (just like building this website), and I think it’ll be nice to contribute to this resource base as well. At the very least, future-me will be happy to have something to refer to when I hit the same obstacle down the road. It’s probably difficult to assign a consistent theme to my blog posts, but expect ramblings about data science, productivity hacks, writing, the environment, design, music…\nFinally, I think websites and blogs are also a refreshing alternative to writing long, academic pieces. It’s often a challenge to make my research relatable to people I talk to, and I feel like what I say doesn’t always do justice to the huge effort put in. Most people aren’t really that interested in the technical details (even my wife! But she tries really hard &lt;3), and digital media definitely helps with science communication.

    "text": "I recently conducted a workshop to teach basic programming in R. It was designed as a crash course for those without coding experience, where we dive right into organising, visualising and analysing data. While it wasn’t meant to be a self-study course, the slides were made to go along with the notes, so anyone should be able to follow along quite nicely. I’ve decided to make the materials freely available on Github.\nCheck out the slides if you’d like to see the potential of the R programming language. I’ve also provided links to useful resources if you’re interested in getting into data science using R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis post is also shared on R-bloggers.com.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{x. p.2019,\n  author = {X.

    "text": "A. Distance matrix and clustering\nExtract all the unique keywords across photos (or subset of photos):\n\nwords &lt;- unlist(photos[,3:12])\nwords &lt;- words[!duplicated(words)] #list of unique keywords\n\n \nNext, we convert photos into a binary format and name it wordscore, with each row representing a photo, and each column representing a keyword. “1” is added if the word is present. We then convert wordscore into a sparse matrix. This will help reduce the load on the computer’s RAM, especially if the photo dataset is very large.\n\n#parallel loop:\nwordscore &lt;- foreach(i = 1:length(photos[,1]), .combine=rbind) %dopar% {\n  vec &lt;- vector(mode = \"integer\",length = length(words))\n  a &lt;- match(photos[i,3:12], words)\n  vec[a] &lt;- 1\n  \n  cat(paste0(\" row \", i), file=paste0(\"admin/log_wordscore.txt\"), append=TRUE) #The loop's progress will be printed in this file\n  vec\n}\ncolnames(wordscore) &lt;- words\nrownames(wordscore) &lt;- NULL\nwordscore &lt;- wordscore[,!is.na(colnames(wordscore))] #remove 'NA' keyword if present\n\nlibrary(Matrix) \nwordscore &lt;- Matrix(wordscore, sparse = TRUE)  #convert to sparseMatrix to save memory\n\n \nIn the binary format, wordscore can now be converted into a distance matrix. To have a fair assessment of the similarity (and thus the distance) between two photos, we need to take into account if they have the same number of keywords generated. The Jaccard Index is used in the calculation, where the number of common keywords is divided by the total number of unique keywords between two photos.\nTo start with, we find out how many keywords each photo has (up to ten), and save the results as the vector lengword:\n\nnarmlength &lt;- function(x){10-sum(is.na(x))} #create function\nlengword &lt;- apply(photos[,3:12], 1, narmlength) #apply function\n\n \nNext, the similarity between each photo and all other photos is calculated manually in a loop, based on the Jaccard Index. Since most photos do not share keywords, the similarity value will tend to be “0” (less strain on computer’s RAM). The similarity matrix (loop output) is then converted into a distance matrix, and subsequently converted into a ‘dist’ object.\n\nsimimat &lt;- foreach(i = 1:length(wordscore[,1]), .packages = \"Matrix\", .combine=cbind) %dopar% {\n  \n  ws &lt;- wordscore[,which(wordscore[i,] == 1)] #for each photo, find the other photos (rows) with its keywords (cols)\n  \n  simi &lt;- round(apply(as.matrix(ws),1,sum, na.rm=T)/(lengword+lengword[i]),2) #Jaccard index\n  \n  simi[1:i] &lt;- 0 #only fill half the matrix\n  simi[i] &lt;- 1\n  \n  cat(paste(\"row\",i), file=paste0(\"admin/log_simimat.txt\"), append=TRUE)\n  \n  simi\n}\n\ncolnames(simimat) &lt;- NULL\nrm(wordscore, lengword)\n\n\n#convert similarity to distance\ndistmat &lt;- 1-simimat\nrm(simimat)\n\n#Convert to a 'dist' object\ndm &lt;- as.dist(distmat)\n\n \nFinally, we perform hierarchical clustering of photos, using Ward’s distance:\n\nrequire(fastcluster)\nrequire(graphics)\n\ncluz &lt;- fastcluster::hclust(dm, \"ward.D2\")\n\n \nGo to ‘B. How many clusters?’ if the number of photo categories has not been determined."

    "section": "B. How many clusters?",
    "text": "B. How many clusters?\nThis section runs as a separate analysis from the final results. Note that the following script may take a long time to run if you have a large dataset.\nIn this analysis, we measure the average difference between within- and between-cluster variation, across different clustering scenarios. Thus, a higher value suggests distinct clusters that are more ‘different’ from each other (i.e. greater variation/distance between clusters). As the number of clusters (k) increases, this value is expected to decrease. We plot these values, and use the L-Method to find the ‘knee’ of the evaluation graph. More information about the L-Method can be found at:\n\nSalvador, S. & Chan, P. Determining the Number of Clusters / Segments in Hierarchical Clustering / Segmentation Algorithms. in 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence 576-584 (IEEE, 2004). doi:10.1109/ICTAI.2004.50\n\n \nFirst, decide up to how many clusters (k) to test for. In this example, we test k from 2 to 20, and save it as the vector scenarios (19 scenarios):\n\nscenarios &lt;- numeric(length(2:20))\n\n \nCreate a function to measure the difference between within- and between-cluster variation across all photos. Run the function for different k values in scenarios.\n\ndiffer &lt;- function(dist, gr, pos){\n  #dist is a single photo's vector of distances with all others\n  #gr is the vector output of grp membership across all photos\n  #pos is the position of the single photo in length(distmat[1,])\n  \n  gr2 &lt;-numeric(length(gr)) #vector of \"0\"s\n  gr2[gr==gr[pos]] &lt;-1 #Which photos are in same cluster as the photo of interest?\n  gr3 &lt;- 1-tapply(dist,gr2, mean) #2 values generated: (1) mean distance compared to photos in other clusters, & (2) compared to photos within same cluster. Minus values from one to convert to similarity value.\n  gr3[2]-gr3[1] #within-cluster minus between-cluster similarity (larger value means clusters are very different)\n}\n\n\n#Run function for different scenarios (numbers of clusters):\nfor(i in 2:(length(scenarios)+1)){\n  grp &lt;- cutree(cluz, k=i)  #cutree returns vector of grp memberships across all photos\n  \n  cat(\"\\n&lt;&lt; Working on scenario k =\", i, \"/\", (length(scenarios)+1), \"&gt;&gt;\\n\")\n  \n  alldiffer &lt;-numeric(length(distmat[,1])) #vector of \"0\"s\"\n  \n  for(j in 1:length(distmat[,1])){ #run function for each photo (across rows)\n    alldiffer[j]&lt;- differ(distmat[j,], grp, j )\n    \n    cat(\"&lt;row\", j, \"/\", length(distmat[,1]), \"photos&gt;\")\n    \n  }\n  scenarios[i-1]&lt;-mean(alldiffer) #find out the mean difference for each scenario (k)\n  \n  cat(\"\\n&lt;&lt; Scenario k =\", i, \"COMPLETE &gt;&gt;\")\n}\n\n\n#Create dataframe\nscenarios &lt;- cbind.data.frame(seq(2,(length(scenarios)+1),1), 1-scenarios) #convert to distance\ncolnames(scenarios) &lt;- c(\"k\", \"distance\")\n\nDo note that the small number of photos in our example produces a relatively straight curve. To help with visualisation, we can also calculate the marginal change in the distance:\n\nfor(i in 2:length(scenarios$distance)){\n  scenarios[i,3] &lt;- scenarios$distance[i-1]-scenarios$distance[i]\n}\n\ncolnames(scenarios) &lt;- c(\"k\",\"distance\",\"marginalDelta\")\n\nHere are plots of the results across different clustering scenarios:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between within- and between-cluster variation, across different clustering scenarios\n\n\n\n \nSince such plots may not always allow us to visually determine the appropriate number of photo clusters, we can also use the L-Method as described in Salvador and Chan (2004). To do so, we plot possible pairs of best-fit lines to the curve, and calculate the total root mean squared error (RMSE) for each pair. The lowest RMSE value is used to determine the number of clusters.\n\nrequire(rgl)\nrequire(qpcR)\n\n#Best-fit line equation:\nmod1 &lt;- lm(distance ~ k, data = scenarios)\n\n\n#Equation from Salvador & Chan (2004):\nfor(i in 3:(max(scenarios$k)-2)){  #lowest value the 'knee' can be at is 3\n  rmse &lt;-  ((i-1)/(max(scenarios$k)-1)*(RMSE(mod1, which = 2:i))) + (((max(scenarios$k)-i)/(max(scenarios$k)-1))*RMSE(mod1, which = (i+1):max(scenarios$k)))\nscenarios[i-1,4] &lt;- rmse\n}\n\ncolnames(scenarios) &lt;- c(\"k\",\"distance\", \"marginalDelta\", \"Lrmse\")\n\n \nNow we can plot RMSE across an increasing number of clusters (k). In our example, the lowest RMSE value is where k = 11. This is the ‘knee’ of the graph. Note that there are a roughly balanced number of points on either side of this value.\n\n\n\n\nTotal RMSE of possible pairs of best-fit lines\n\n\n\n \nNow it’s time to classify our photos and visualise the categories for good. Go back to ‘A. Distance matrix and clustering’ and re-run the script for the full dataset if a subset of data was used to determine the number of clusters. If not, continue on to the next section…"
